        <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> Motivation: The urgency and
            scale of mass adult immunization for COVID-19 presents a huge challenge for any low- and middle-income
            country (LMIC) like Bangladesh. Our analysis focuses on demand-side constraints early in the vaccination
            campaign to help gauge vaccine acceptability and potential contributing factors. Identifying registration
            and compliance challenges early on will help ensure a seamless immunization programme.
            <br>Purpose: We seek to identify subgroups who may need specific interventions by comparing willingness to
            be vaccinated and registration behaviour, and to understand how actual registration and take-up decisions
            compare between rural areas and urban slum areas.
            <br>Approach and Methods: We use data from three surveys conducted between late January and early September
            2021. The article includes a nationally representative survey on vaccine acceptability and a study on
            vaccination rollout behaviour in rural and urban slums.
            <br>Findings: Willingness was not an issue in Bangladesh, but the challenge was getting individuals to
            register. Once they did, compliance was very high. When the information gap regarding registration was
            addressed by campaigning, registration and take-up increased. Confidence in public service delivery
            influenced favourable responses to mass immunization efforts. Women were falling behind initially in terms
            of both registration knowledge and completion. Online registration needed to be complemented with
            alternatives. Social networking was a vital source of information and encouragement.
            <br>Policy implications: Communication strategies are necessary to inform the public at an early stage, and
            these should provide information about registration eligibility and detailed registration instructions.
            Ensuring and sustaining service quality is also beneficial. In LMICs like Bangladesh, low-tech intensive
            registration methods are required. Information campaigns about the registration procedure should
            specifically target rural communities and women. Community-based mechanisms may reduce transaction costs and
            increase confidence.

            Evidence from Labour Force Survey Data</a> <br> with Sayema Haque Bidisha and Tanveer Mahmood (<b>2022,
            South Asia Economic Journal </b>)
            <button class="accordion"> Abstract</button>
        <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;">
            In Bangladesh, despite increased participation in the labour market in recent decades, women are still
            lagging behind men by a significant margin, with the former being concentrated chiefly in low-paid
            agriculture as well as in the lower stages of the occupational ladder. With the help of the latest labour
            market data of 2016–2017 coupled with 2011 census data, this article attempts to examine gender segregation
            through sectoral and occupational lenses. Our econometric estimation of different sectors (agriculture,
            manufacturing, construction and service) reflects the importance of gender-centric factors such as care
            burden and marital status along with local employment opportunities in constraining women’s labour market
            engagement. Besides, decomposition analysis highlights that unfavourable returns to endowments play a
            crucial role in females’ concentration in relatively low-productive sectors. Sectoral and occupational
            segregation indices reflect a high degree of segregation between men and women. Thus, against the backdrop
            of the concentration of women in low-skilled jobs and a low-productive sector, this article expects to
            provide important policy insights for boosting female employment in relatively high-productive sectors and
            high-paid occupations while utilizing the structural shift in the labour market of Bangladesh.

        <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> With deep-seated gender
            imbalances prevalent in Bangladesh, it is compelling to understand how those women, who do manage to get
            employed, are faring in terms of equity. A popular approach involves analysing the gender wage gap across
            the entire distribution. With the assistance of the latest data from QLFS 2016–2017, the gender wage gap is
            decomposed, with selection issues addressed by Buchinsky (J Appl Econom 13(1):1–30, 1998) method. The paper
            has then proceeded to posit the existence of a strong sticky floor effect and a weaker glass ceiling effect
            in Bangladesh, with discriminatory rewards to observed characteristics being the dominant feature of the
            observed wage gap across the entire distribution. Women face discrimination at the bottom end chiefly due to
            differences in returns. On the other hand, women at the top are subject to extensive discrimination despite
            being superior to men in terms of endowment. Consequently, low-earning women require access to jobs which
            reward their skills as much as their male counterparts; the same holds true for the high-income group. There
            is also evidence of selection bias for both genders. Policy prescriptions based on these findings and
            potential avenues for further scope concerning the paper are also mentioned in the end.

            <button class="accordion"> Abstract</button>
        <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> The paper constructs a model
            to show the relative welfare reductions of the new poor, who are less agile in their shock response compared
            to the old poor, in the presence of addictive habits and temptation. Addiction to a previous better
            lifestyle differentiates them from the old poor and leads to lower adaptability in behavior during the
            initial stages of an economic shock. The new poor households, provided that they do not either go cold
            turkey or regret and rectify their actions, lose out from four channels:(i) fewer resources to consume in
            the pre-shock period as they save up for the shock period;(ii) growing addictive behavior due to their
            failure to adapt;(iii) temptation goods increasing ‘impatience’or first-period consumption, raising
            addiction and increasing the latter’s consumption share as the new poor’s consumption levels fall; and,
            perhaps most importantly,(iv) a dwindling share of the essential normal good from this multitude of effects
            during an economic crisis.

            discussions these sentiments are seated. Additionally, using a range of discursive analytical measures, we
            explore the interactions between enumerators and participants in live survey conditions, providing
            alternative methods to and potential field guidance for enumerator survey methods.

        <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> The social and economic
            impact of COVID-19 has been deep, wide-ranging, and multi-dimensional. While anecdotal evidence of distress
            among the poor, particularly those with informal occupations, has been widespread, effective policy response
            has required real-time, researched data disaggregated for urban and rural populations and for various
            categories of the poor. The Power and Participation Research Centre and BRAC Institute of Governance and
            Development’s four-round panel survey during 2020–21 provides unique insights into how COVID-19 impacted
            specific categories of the poor and vulnerable in Bangladesh, their coping strategies, and the extent to
            which policy support materialized. While the poor as a whole demonstrated their agency in the face of the
            crisis, their resilience has been as much about deepening vulnerability as about recovery, representing an
            unfair burden of distress resilience. Informal workers, women, and the urban poor have been
            disproportionately impacted.

        <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> This BIGD study examines the
            impact of COVID-19’s impact on the major economic and financial indicators of the economy of Bangladesh,
            including production, wages, price levels, advances, bills, investments, remittances and foreign trade,
            using the secondary data published by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS), Bangladesh Bank (BB), and
            the Ministry of Finance (MoF). In addition to the recent impact of the global economic meltdown, Bangladesh
            also experienced severe demand contraction in the local economy; this exacerbated the overall economic
            crisis of the country. Considering the duration and severity of COVID-19, we examine its impact on major
            economic and financial indicators of the Bangladesh economy and recommended policy responses for recovery,
            based on the analysis. Both domestic and international demands declined due to the outbreak and subsequent
            lockdown, and, thus, producers responded by lowering output to minimize the loss, especially in the
            manufacturing sectors. Findings reveal that the nominal Wage Rate Index (WRI) in the industry and service
            sectors fell in recent times, which now appears to be recovering. The national inflation rate has not been
            affected much based-on point-to-point changes. Food inflation fell in May 2020 and stood at 5.09 percent,
            but it appears to have risen recently. Non-food inflation rates have been falling over the last six months
            since April-September 2020. Prudent measures should include constant monitoring and adapting to the latest
            developments in major trading partners and host countries to mitigate the economic losses caused. Bank
            credit would play a key role in the ongoing and upcoming recovery process, as the government has opted for a
            credit-led stimulus package.

            <button class="accordion"> Abstract</button>
        <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> Various activities undertaken
            by the government include widening coverage of the social safety nets to protect the poor and the new poor
            due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite such an increase in social protection coverage and spending amid
            COVID-19, many of the poor are still excluded due to the lack of a social registry and proper implementation
            and distribution strategies. This study aims to critically scrutinize the Bangladesh government’s support
            under the umbrella of social protection during COVID-19 in order to assess the social justice agenda based
            on a systematic inquiry to look at the secondary data. It also tries and identifies the drawbacks, which are
            rooted in the existing social protection framework, associated with the planning, designing, programming,
            and delivery of the various social protection programs and projects in order to ensure social justice from
            the rights, governance, distribution, and access perspectives. More specifically, the scoping study would
            help highlight the caveats of Bangladesh’s social protection during pandemics and identify the scope of
            future research and policy actions to mitigate the potential impacts of future shocks on the livelihoods of
            the poor, marginalized and impoverished people by constructing a comprehensive and dynamic social protection
            system.

            COVID-19 Vaccination: Willingness and Practice in Bangladesh</a> <br> with Ishmam Al-Quddus (<b> 2021 </b>)

                Abstract
            </button>
        <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> With the launch of the
            nationwide vaccination program in Bangladesh on 7 February 2021, the country—intending to immunize 80% of
            the population in three phases—is gearing up to take the next step in combating the novel Coronavirus. This
            report aims to shed light on the COVID-19 vaccination program in Bangladesh by means of three surveys
            conducted over various periods of time, from late January to the end of March 2021. We begin by tracing out
            the events starting from the first discussions on the vaccine in Bangladesh to all the way up to the end of
            March this year with the help of media tracking, and then proceed to capture the factors which determine
            one’s willingness to be vaccinated (WTV) in Bangladesh, with a focus on governance-related factors. We also
            investigate the differences between the borderline cases. Additionally, we analyze the temporal differences
            for the youth in terms of WTV. We then discuss our findings of WTV among the urban slum residents. Finally,
            we present the findings of vaccine registration-related factors among urban slum and rural respondents. The
            study found a rather high WTV prevailing nationally in early February 2021. The majority of those unwilling
            to be vaccinated do not feel the necessity of it. Proportionately more urban slum dwellers had heard about
            the registration compared to rural residents. Women are falling behind in terms of both registration
            knowledge and completion. The same is also true for certain occupation groups. Social networks and mass
            media are vital sources of information, and the former is also a major source of encouragement.

        <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;">The report discusses the major
            findings on the educational life of rural and urban slum-dwelling children in Bangladesh during COVID-19,
            based on two rounds of surveys in March and August 2021. The data was collected as part of a larger study
            that has been tracking the livelihoods of the citizens in rural and urban slums since the pandemic hit the
            country. The larger study is a collaborative effort between the BRAC Institute of Governance and Development
            (BIGD) and the Power and Participation Research Centre (PPRC). Poor quality of education was a grave concern
            in Bangladesh even before the pandemic, and the long school closure during COVID-19 has worsened the quality
            problems. Early into the pandemic, research by BIGD indicated the likelihood of significant learning losses
            due to schools closing. In this phase of the joint study by PPRC and BIGD, the authors examine the learning
            loss trend, the role of mother’s education in learning loss risk, digital inclusion in remote learning
            methods, the mental health of primary and secondary schoolchildren, and the indirect effects of the
            pandemic, such as the high incidence of child labour. Male students in secondary school were found to be at
            the highest risk of learning loss, possibly due to the livelihood pressure induced by the pandemic.
